# TTM Potential for Python

This directory contains a Python wrapper for the TTM interaction potential for water.

The TTM wrapper was originally developed by Joseph Heindel and packaged for distribution by Logan Ward.

## Requirements

You must have Python with numpy installed and a Fortran compiler.

The installation instructions (below) assume that you have gFortran, 
though it should be possible to install with other Fortran compilers
by editing [`Makefile.ttm`](./Makefile.ttm).

## Installation

The first step is to download and build the TTM library from UW/PNNL.
If you are running Linux and have gFortran, calling

```bash
./get-ttm.sh
```

will download and build the library.

Once the library is compiled, install the package with 

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

We recommend using the TTM potential through the [ASE Calculator](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html)
interface provided by this package.

```python
from ttm.ase import TTMCalculator
import ase

atoms = ase.Atoms()
calc = TTMCalculator()
energy = calc.get_potential_energy(atoms)
```
